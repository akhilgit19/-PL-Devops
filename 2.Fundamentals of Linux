		https://chmod-calculator.com/
	
		chmod <Access_Level> <File/Directory_Name>
		
		chmod 600 s1.txt

		chmod 600 dir1
		
		As a best practise chmod 777 should not be used at any cause!
		
		
		
	- User Management 	:::
	
	
		Create Linux User :

		SSH Connection :	Secure SHell Connection 
		
			-> Host Name 
			-> User Name 
			-> User Authentication 


			-> Authentication Types :
			
				- Password Based Authentication
				
				- Key Based Authentication
					- Public Key 
					- Private Key 
					- authorized keys




		How to Create Linux User ?
		
			Username : devopsadmin 
			
			Bash Terminal Access :
			
			Home Dir :
			
			password :
			
			ssh-keys :



		Create Linux User with SSH Keys :::
		
			sudo -i 
			
			useradd devopsadmin -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/devopsadmin

			su - devopsadmin

			ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521					#ubuntu 22.04 or higher version of ubuntu				

			cd .ssh
			
			ls ~/.ssh 

			#You should see following two files:

			#id_ecdsa - private key
			#id_ecdsa.pub - public
			
			
			cat id_ecdsa.pub > authorized_keys			# authorized_keys this file name should be same.
			
			authorized_keys :::
				It is the copy of Public Key.
				
				Always the private key will be compared with the authorized_keys
				
			chmod 600 /home/devopsadmin/.ssh/*					# Used to Change the Access Mode of Files or Directories
			
			chown -R devopsadmin:devopsadmin /opt/tomcat/		# Used to Change the Ownership of Files or Directories
			
			
		Get the List of Linux Users ::::
			cat /etc/passwd
		
		Get the list of Linux User Groups :::: 
			cat /etc/group
	
		Create Password to any Linux User:
		
			As a root user ::
			
				passwd <user_name>
				
		root@ip-172-31-46-175:~# passwd devopsadmin
		New password:
		Retype new password:
		passwd: password updated successfully

		2. Login to the Remote Server 
		3. Copy the Files from one server to another server
			using SCP
		4. Manage the Remote Server - Install any package/Uninstall/Upgrade 
		
		Pre-requisites for Remote Server :::
		
			- Launch 2 VMs (VM1-Source & VM2-Target)
			
			- Ensure that Port 22 is enabled 
			
			- Create User in both the VMs 
			
			- Create SSH-Key in one server(VM1)
					ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521
					
			- Use the public_Key as a authorized_keys in the target server(VM2)
			
			- Establish SSH Connection & Login to VM2(Target_Machine)
			
			- Copy Files from VM1 to VM2(Target_Machine)
	
		Server1 --> 
		
			-> Authentication : Tells who can access the Server 	
			
			-> Authorization : Tells what can be done on that Server
			
				Client_Machine ::::

			- Create User in both the VMs ::::
			
				useradd adminuser1 -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/adminuser1

				su - adminuser1					

			- Use the public_Key as a authorized_keys in the target server(VM2) :::

				mkdir .ssh 

				cd .ssh 


				vi authorized_keys

				#paste the id_ecdsa.pub of devopsadmin user from Server machine to authorized_keys file in Client Machine 

				chmod 600 /home/adminuser1/.ssh/*


			- Establish SSH Connection & Login to VM2(Target_Machine)

					ssh adminuser1@172.31.15.92				# Using Private IP Address
					
					ssh adminuser1@13.232.227.2				# Using Public IP Address

email
			
			- Copy Files from VM1 to VM2(Target_Machine)
			

				#cp  /home/devopsadmin/sourcefile.txt home/devopsadmin/dir1/
		
				 scp /home/devopsadmin/sourcefile.txt adminuser1@172.31.15.92:/home/adminuser1

		
		
	- Process Automation(Shell Scripting) :::	
	
	
		Fundamentals of Shell Scripting :
		
			Scripting Languages ?
				- Are used to perform some process automation/validations
				- Light-weight 
				- Eg.: java scripts / shell scripts / yaml script / groovy / python 
					(vs)
			Progamming Language ?
				- Are used to create some business applications 
				- Huge Collection of Programming components
				- Eg.: Java/.Net Framework/Python/Ruby/Cobol/C
				
				
	Shell Scripting Language :
	
		- Shell Scripting is a collection shell commands 
		- Shell Script file should be saved as *.sh (Extention should be .sh)
		
	Install git ?
	
		Install all these packages in 200 VMs :::
	
		apt install openjdk11 -y
		apt install git -y 
		apt install maven -y 
		apt install docker.io -y
		apt install ansible -y 
		
		Shell Script :
		
vi installbuildtools.sh 

	
		
				
					
					
	Build Environment Server (VM):	To Perform Application Build - Identify the Source Code,Compile,Create Artifacts(Binaries)
	
		- Install all the required build tools : 1 Build Server ==> 50 Build Server!
		
				- apt install git -y  
				- apt install jdk -y 
				- apt install maven -y 			# Build Tool 
				- apt install docker.io -y 		# To Containerize Application
				
				
			vi javamaven-buildconfig.sh
			
				sudo apt install git -y  
	            sudo apt install jdk -y 
	            sudo apt install maven -y 		
                sudo apt install docker.io -y 	
				
				
			Test Servers :::
			
			
				- testing tools - TestNG / Selenium / jdk / docker
				
				
			Periodic Server Management :::
			
			
				- Clean-up 
				
					rm dir!
					
			Periodic Backup of Files/Directories
				

				#!/bin/bash
				sudo apt install git -y 
				sudo apt install openjdk11 -y
				sudo apt install maven -y 
				sudo apt install docker.io -y
				#sudo apt install ansible -y 

				save the script as installbuildtools.sh 

				/home/devopsadmin/scripts/$ ls 
				installbuildtools.sh	

				/home/devopsadmin/scripts/$ ./installbuildtools.sh		# Run the Shell Script!
