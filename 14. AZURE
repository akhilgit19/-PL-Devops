Cloud Deployments Models:
================================
Public Cloud:
--------------

Public Cloud: Now the entire IT industry is moving and migrating their applications to Public cloud, 
we are having many cloud vendors (ex; Microsoft Azure, AWS, GCP, Oracle cloud, Salesforce, IBM…etc.) 
these cloud providers are offering their cloud computing platform with public cloud concept, till now
the entire IT industry, the organizations/IT firms were having their own cloud (private cloud) and now 
the public cloud is available for all. Public cloud means the platform is available and accessible for all,
not our resources/services & data. We have to create an account/subscription in the vendors platform and then
will get an identity & with authentication/authorization process will happen to login 
to our subscription in the cloud platform then it will allow us to create the resources/services which all 
we need as per our application and project requirements.


ex- aws,azure gcp, saleforce
ex- gmail, outlook

Private Cloud:
--------------
Private Cloud/On-prem: Till now the entire IT industry(from decades), 
the IT firms/Organizations were having their own cloud and that is called a private cloud,
the IT firms were maintaining these infrastructure/Datacenters on their own expenses and responsibilities 
and this was accessible only for them. And they are responsible and accountable if some misshaped/disaster 
happened that is either natural disaster or manmade disaster have occurred.


-infrascture/datcenters
 VM's
 Networks
 Databases
 NSG's
 Loadbalancers
 TMP,
 Appservices,
 AKS
 Container services etc

Hybrid Cloud:
---------------
Hybrid Cloud: It is a combination of Public and Private cloud. (Ex : 
let us say our frontend application servers are hosted in cloud as public and DB servers
are in on-prem, now using VPN will connect from our back end server(i.e.. On-prem) to front 
end server(ie. On cloud) this type of Setup/Scenarios is called Hybrid cloud)

-combination of public and private cloud



Advantages of Cloud Computing:
1)24/7 availability & accessibility: It is available & accessible from anywhere & at any time we only need to have device and internet connectivity to access the Azure resources/services.
2)Scalability: The face of transformation is very simple and ease in cloud computing (ex; resizing of resources/workloads/services…etc.) and that can be done just with click of a mouse.
3)Security: it is using a very high security algorithms and Hash functions to protect our data & resources.
4)Enhanced collaboration: Just in one platform(portal.azure.com) you are going to get all the resources/services that what you need for your project or application requirement. 
5)Cost effective: It is very much cheap an economical as compared to private cloud or an old legacy system.
6)Reliable: Cloud services are consistently good in quality with equal performance even if we perform multiple enhancements on them.



Different cloud services/cloud service MODELS: 
====================================================
In cloud service model, the cloud providers gives it services in three different ways(i.e. IAAS, PAAS,SAAS)
1)IAAS >>Infrastructure as a Service(Ex of IAAS is : VM, SA, Vnet, Entra ID…etc.)
2)PAAS >>Platform as a Service(Ex of PAAS is : SQL DB, Cosmo DB, Web apps, App services, Azure Bastion host, Azure Firewalls, Logic Apps, Function Apps…….etc.)
3)SAAS >>Software as a Service(Ex of SAAS is : Skype, Gmail, FB, WhatsApp…etc.)
The difference between these 3 service models….is shown below.

What is Microsoft Azure: 
=================================
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications 
(Business Applications) and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.

 Advantages/Features of Azure Cloud Computing:
=================================================
As It is a product of Microsoft as Microsoft has launched many frameworks, tools, IDE’s, languages for the applications development 
and all the applications are doing great business from decades, hence clients in the market has got that faith & trust saying Microsoft 
products are reliable, reasonable, efficient and even economical for software applications development.
Compare to AWS the learning/working curve of Microsoft Azure Cloud Computing is small. Azure is easy to work, easy to learn, easy 
to manage, there is no such pre-requisites required to learn Azure, no programming language understanding is required to work in Azure 
cloud computing.
Azure is cheap as compare to other cloud providers (4-12%)
If you are making Azure as your cloud computing partner then it is offering you MS office, WPS office, Lync, skype, share point...etc. 
and other platform available at cheaper cost which ultimately needed for our applications/project developments.
As compared with other cloud providers Azure is offering you many regions/places to deploy/provisioning/creating your resources 
(VM's, SA's, DB's, Vnet, NSG’s, Backup’s...etc.)for our software applications.
Azure is using a very high security algorithms and Hash functions to protect your data and resources what all is been provisioned 
in different regions.
Azure is providing default encryption for all your services that you are provisioning in cloud computing platform, with which it 
is not at all easy for any ethical hacker to hack / hijack the resources which are hosted in Azure Cloud Computing Platform.



Azure Resources/Services:
==============================
A public cloud computing platform, Microsoft Azure offers infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and a serverless model. A constant hybrid cloud, Microsoft Azure is growing in demand with approximately 90% of the Fortune 500 companies using Azure services.
The Azure cloud services are trained and created to deploy and manage even complex apps, through virtual infrastructure. It supports various programming languages, devices, databases, operating systems, and extensive frameworks. Therefore, Azure services intended for the professionals and enterprises offer all-around alternatives to the traditional means of organizational processes, with top Azure services greatly improving the performance.
(or)
Azure Resources/Services: Anything that you are creating/deploying as part of your application need or project requirement is called as Resources or services.


Example of Resources/Services: 
(i)Virtual machine>>IAAS (ii)Databases>>PAAS (iii)Storage Accounts>>IAAS
(iv)Virtual Networks>>IAAS (v) Load Balancers>>IAAS 
(vi)Docker Container instances>>PAAS (vii)Docker Container Registry>>PAAS (viii)NSG's>>IAAS
(ix)App services>>PAAS (x)Azure Repo's>>PAAS (xi)Azure Pipelines>>PAAS
(xii)Azure CI/CD>>PAAS



Azure Resource Groups & Configuration and management of Azure Resource groups for hosting Azure services:
=========================================================
It is a place holder/name/folder basically which hold all our resources in azure. It is a logical container which holds all our resources in Azure portal (or) in Azure resource manager, for each resource that you are creating in Azure must and should be in any of the resource group.  We cannot create a resource in Azure without a resource group.
We can also move the resources from one resource group to another resource group (or) from one subscription to another subscription, but the tools & Scripts associated with moved resources will not work until we update them to use new resource ID’s.
If there are plenty of resources or big size resources in resource group then it might lead a downtime (15-20 mins), so planning of moving resources should be down in non-business hours.
If already an operation of moving resources is in-progress, then at the same time we cannot proceed to move further resources to move to the same resource group. We have to wait until this operation has been completed.
If you are having 10 Resource Group(RG's)...you can take any RG to create your resources, but you should create one RG first before creating anything in cloud portal.
we can create as many as RG's we want in Azure portal
we can keep as many as resources we want in one RG.
we create RGs to divide the cloud services logically....we are creating the infrastructure for applications and every application is having different environments....
In Azure portal RG’s will not charge you any billing/amount the moment you start keeping the resources inside the RG’s then your billing will get started


Subscriptions:
===================
- click on home, click on subscriptions in the seachbar , you will get the amount limit of your account 


Resource groups:
===================
Basics:

- click on home, click on resource group in the serach bar, 
- subscription- azure subscritpino1
  resource group name- BOFA_DEV_RG
  Region:  Austrialia EAST
  Tags:
- Name :      value             Resource
  application: BankofAmerica  
  Owner      : Davic Maclarean
  Enviroment : Dev
  type       : FrontEndResources

- click on create resource group


What is a virtual machine(VM)/Cloud SERVER/Work loads: 
==================================================================
It is a software computer that runs an operating system(o/s) & applications in it. It also contains set of resources in it (ex : O/S disk, Storage disks, Network, IP’s, NSG, NIC… other supporting files, other networks….etc.)
When we are creating a VM then the below components we have to consider broadly
(i)Hardware 
(ii)Subscription 
(iii)Resource group 
(iv)Network 
(v)Storage account 
(vi) O/s(windows or linux)
(vii)Data Disk
(viii)OS Disk
(vii)Load Balancer (viii)VPN….etc.
 When we are creating a VM via portal then we have to fill the below tabs.

SA
---- 

When ever we want to upload or keep the data in cloud computing then we use,we create storage accounts.
Storage account or storage services is one of means of uploading the data or keep the data in cloud computing.
Storage accounts will accept any type of data... what ever the data is it will accept all types of dtaa


Structured Data[ Ex: Fix no of rows and colunnds.. CSV, Excel..etc]
Semi-Structured Data[ Ex: HTML., ARM templates, XML, YAML..etc]
Un- Structured Data[ Ex: Videos, Images, PDF files, Word, vision diagrams..etc]

Broadly we are having 3 different types of storage  acconts(A)
Standard/Blob SA is having 4 different types of storage offerings

 1) Blob Storage Services>> again divided into 3 different types of blobs
  i) Page Blob
      Here will upload the unstructured data. Videso Images, VM disk, Database backup files, Master database filess..etc]
  ii)Append Blob
      Here will upload the  Resources logs, Historical datam, Structured  data
  iii)Block Blob
      Here will upload the general data, lke project related documents[ words, excel, pdf, images, HTML,ARM templates..etc]


2) File share storage services
     Here will upload flat files, raw files and even other general project relateed documents[ words, excel, pdf, images, HTML,ARM templates..etc]


3) Table Storage Services
     Here  we can upload the data which is in the  form a table[ Rows and column]

4) Queue Storage Services

     Here we can upload the data which is in the  form of a text messages
    [Exlike SMS, Promotional Messages, notifications etc]

You have uploaded some 200 files inside your SA, and nnow some 40 files you have deleted after 3 days or 5 fays
you realizes that the files were important and you want the files back
then ins this scenarios and sitautions the data protection tab is ehelpful

- data protection
  - enable soft delete for blobs
    ddays to retain the deleted blobs
  - enable soft delte for containers
    days to retain delted containers
  -enalb soft delte for file shares

Tracking

- eanble versioning for blobs
- enable blobo change feed

=========
Premum SA:

Yesterday we have deployed Blob/Standard SA
Today will see how we can deploy Premium SA
99.95.. ONLY Just one extra clikcyou  have to for the premium SA.

In bloc/Standard SA you are getting all 4 different stoarge offerrings
In premium SA you are supposed to choose what storage offering you want

Performanc: Premium
Premium account tyope ; page blobs

- You will see only one storage account for premium


- click onn blob storage service in the storage account
- click on add containers
- name
- click on create
- now click on the created container
- click on switch to acces key
- click on upload
- click on browse for files
- you can upgrade from block blob from page blob while uploading by clicking on advanced, page blob is from unstructured data, click on upload
- for apend blob. you can go to any resource click on acitvity log and download the .csv file
- now go to the storage acccount , go to the created coontainer, click on upload click on apend blob , browse and upload the.csv file
  
- for user access
- clickon the file, click on generate SAS
- Permissions
  Read,add,create,writee,delete,permanent delte,tags
- start and expirday date
- allowed ip address
- allowed protocols
     choose https and http
- click on Generate SAS token and URL
- copy Blob SAS URL , past that in the browser , You can see the file
- You can change the access level on the container by clickin on the 3 options , container level, blob level,private level access,container level access, choose blob level 
  the url is direclty accessable



-In File share:

- click on file share
basic
- click name- plfs
- access tier - transaction optimized, hot ,cool
- performance
- 
backup
revidw + create
- click on create file share 
- now got one of the file share, click on browse
- upload the files

Block blob>> that files can be accessed via browser with URL
page blob
append blob

Fileshareblob->> the files cannot be accessed via browser using URL
 Inorder to access the files inised the fileshare we have to host this fileshare on top of a server and this server we called\
it as file share server.

To host a file share on top of a server we have be opening an SMB services on the  network on which our srver is hosted
the port no for SMB services is 445

Once we host the file share on top of a server then this file share will becomes part of the server

Now qyuiclky deply a server.

While designing our Vnet in cloud computing based upon the mask bits the No of IP address count will be dcided

10.0.0/16>>

The mask bit and ip counts are inversely proportionali to each other
if you increase the mask bit no then ip counts will decrease in your vnet.
if you decrease the mask bit no then iP counts will increase in your vnet
How many resources tha tyou are having in your projects, depends upon the project size will will decide the iP


17th OCT
==============

Network Security Group( NSG) :
-----------------------------------
In  Network Security Group( NSG) will implement the inbound and outbound traffice for our VM
Here ins Network security group NSG will decide our VM should talk to which services and 
networksecuritygroups

vnets
subnets



loadbalancers
-------------------
-
i f we want lb to balance network traffic between the VM then the VM should be in 
same RG
same network
same region
saem avaialblity set also the vm sshould not have an ip address
we are adding vm isnide the LB not lb inside the vm


VNET Peering
-------------
- Cretae 2 vnets with multiple subnets in different regions 
- click on create resource group

- now do it for second vnet
- now deploy 2 vm on eac vnet
  create virtuma machine
  vm name
  region
  availablitu option no infrascture
  image
  username
  password
  ibound rules
  disks
  networking
  - check vnetname it should second vnetname
  review+create
- now connect to both the vms
- now in first vm
  open the command prompt
- now go back to virtualnetworks
- open one of the vnet click on peering
- perring link name
- virutal network - second vnet name
- remote virtual network peering setting
  allow myvnet 1 to mynet2
  allow myvnet1 to receive forwarde traffic from myvnet2
-  local virutal network smmary
    peering linkname
- local virtual netwokr peering setting
  allow mynet1971 to access  myvnet1973
  allow my net1971 to receied forwarded traffic from myvnet1973
- give the firewall rule
- now try ping to vm2 it will work

Basically at the time of VM creation we are having some basic  provisioning of  ports[ HTTPS, HTTPS, SSH, RDP]
If we want to open/deny apart from this 4 services we use network security group [RDP,SMTP]
If we want to have the complete control on our VM and even teh control of  network traffic inside the VM THEN WE CAN MAKE US OF aZURE FIREWALLS.

How we can schedule the backups of our Azure VMS:
Recovery services valut(RSV) this is an inbuild service we have in azure cloud computing( PAAS)
Mostly we use this RSV services to schedule and take the backups
RSV heps us to schedule the automated backups.
RSV helps us to take the full VM backup, but it will not hlpe us to taked customized backups.
RSV helps us to take the future disks backups.
RSV can take the backup only when the VM and RSV region is common.
RSV is region dependent, if the region

In RSV how we can schedule the backup policies for our virtual machines

Recovery services valult(RSV) can take the backups of the VMS's only when  the regions are common
RSV region  and VM region are same then nly the backup is possible

right now my VM1 is having only c drive if at all after 2 months if i attached 2 more disks to my VM1 then the RSV will take
the backup of this 2 new disks also.

Now for vm2 backup we have to create another RSV in the australia east region  then only it is possible 
to schedule the VM2 backup

In RSV we can take file share backups also

Azure Active Directory(AAD
Servers
storage accounts
resrouc groups
load balancer
virtual networks ..etc

10 Members
1) Firstly will learn how we can onboard the users in microsoft entra ID
2) I made a login to azure portal with the same user  id
3) we have just onboarded the user , we have not provided any access to  any of the resources
   in azure cloud computing to the user theats why when the user logged in with his  credentials he is not able to see 
  any of the resources

When we are deploying our webapp on top of Azure Vm;s then that is considered as IAAS
When we are deploying our webapp on top of app services then that is considered  as pAAS

Course-End Project-1:
======================
Implementing and automating the Azure Devops CI/CD Pipelines and a Project to host a ELearning web application for an Ed-tech company on modern cloud infrastructure for students, interns, university graduates and course completion students via Azure Devops CI/CD pipelines.

Project Agenda: Hosting ELearning Web App on Azure App Services [PAAS] using Azure Devops CI/CD Pipelines
===============

Description:
======================
PLL technologies is one of the reputed Ed-tech who are offering variety of different online/offline course for Students, Interns, University Alumni to offer variety of different courses for cutting edge technologies, The Ed-tech is based in the south Asian countries like (India, China, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan... Etc). The Ed-tech is helping students, interns and college alumni’s with different courses offerings as per their area of interest, the courses related to software’s development for cutting edge technologies (like: Cloud Computing, Devops, AI+ML, Cyber Security, IT Consulting, IT Infrastructure, Database Management, Azure Fundamentals, Azure Administration, Azure Devops, AWS cloud practitioners, AWS Solutions Architect…. etc).
AnilIT Ed-tech IT department treats its Web App as mission-critical and wants it to be available all the time, as in its absence, they will not be able to give a best impression and experience for their customers of their products, which can result in business loss.


Technical briefing of the Project:
===================================
This project will divide in multiple parts. i.e: Azure Repo’s, Build pipeline, Release pipeline & Azure App Services and in Build Pipeline if developers makes any change in Azure devops repository it will trigger the build pipeline automatically and pulls the code from its source repository and updates the code in Azure devops CI/CD pipelines.
Release Pipeline will be automatically triggered and it will pull the artifact from the build pipeline and this image it will deploy on Azure App Services and hence will able to see the complete Web Application is been hosted on top of Azure App Services(Web App…PAAS).
