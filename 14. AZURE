When ever we want to upload or keep the data in cloud computing then we use,we create storage accounts.
Storage account or storage services is one of means of uploading the data or keep the data in cloud computing.
Storage accounts will accept any type of data... what ever the data is it will accept all types of dtaa


Structured Data[ Ex: Fix no of rows and colunnds.. CSV, Excel..etc]
Semi-Structured Data[ Ex: HTML., ARM templates, XML, YAML..etc]
Un- Structured Data[ Ex: Videos, Images, PDF files, Word, vision diagrams..etc]

Broadly we are having 3 different types of storage  acconts(A)
Standard/Blob SA is having 4 different types of storage offerings

 1) Blob Storage Services>> again divided into 3 different types of blobs
  i) Page Blob
      Here will upload the unstructured data. Videso Images, VM disk, Database backup files, Master database filess..etc]
  ii)Append Blob
      Here will upload the  Resources logs, Historical datam, Structured  data
  iii)Block Blob
      Here will upload the general data, lke project related documents[ words, excel, pdf, images, HTML,ARM templates..etc]


2) File share storage services
     Here will upload flat files, raw files and even other general project relateed documents[ words, excel, pdf, images, HTML,ARM templates..etc]


3) Table Storage Services
     Here  we can upload the data which is in the  form a table[ Rows and column]

4) Queue Storage Services

     Here we can upload the data which is in the  form of a text messages
    [Exlike SMS, Promotional Messages, notifications etc]

You have uploaded some 200 files inside your SA, and nnow some 40 files you have deleted after 3 days or 5 fays
you realizes that the files were important and you want the files back

In bloc/Standard SA you are getting all 4 different stoarge offerrings
In premium SA you are supposed to choose what storage offering you want

append blob

Fileshareblob->> the files cannot be accessed via browser using URL
 Inorder to access the files inised the fileshare we have to host this fileshare on top of a server and this server we called\
it as file share serer.

To host a file share on top of a server we have be opening an SMB services on the  network on which our srver is hosted
the port no for SMB services is 445

Once we host the file share on top of a server then this file share will becomes part of the server

Now qyuiclky deply a server.

Basically at the time of VM creation we are having some basic  provisioning of  ports[ HTTPS, HTTPS, SSH, RDP]
If we want to open/deny apart from this 4 services we use network security group [RDP,SMTP]
If we want to have the complete control on our VM and even teh control of  network traffic inside the VM THEN WE CAN MAKE US OF aZURE FIREWALLS.
