 - No infrastructure redundancy required 
    I  use this option when i dont want azure to maintain multiple copies or  bakcups of VM
    I  use this option when i dont want Azure to  take care of my VM
    I use this option for  low level enviroments[ Ex: Dev, QA, Staging, Demo..
    if i use this option then i will get less billing

When ever we want to upload or keep the data in cloud computing then we use,we create storage accounts.
Storage account or storage services is one of means of uploading the data or keep the data in cloud computing.
Storage accounts will accept any type of data... what ever the data is it will accept all types of dtaa


Structured Data[ Ex: Fix no of rows and colunnds.. CSV, Excel..etc]
Semi-Structured Data[ Ex: HTML., ARM templates, XML, YAML..etc]
Un- Structured Data[ Ex: Videos, Images, PDF files, Word, vision diagrams..etc]

Broadly we are having 3 different types of storage  acconts(A)
Standard/Blob SA is having 4 different types of storage offerings

 1) Blob Storage Services>> again divided into 3 different types of blobs
  i) Page Blob
      Here will upload the unstructured data. Videso Images, VM disk, Database backup files, Master database filess..etc]
  ii)Append Blob
      Here will upload the  Resources logs, Historical datam, Structured  data
  iii)Block Blob
      Here will upload the general data, lke project related documents[ words, excel, pdf, images, HTML,ARM templates..etc]


2) File share storage services
     Here will upload flat files, raw files and even other general project relateed documents[ words, excel, pdf, images, HTML,ARM templates..etc]


3) Table Storage Services
     Here  we can upload the data which is in the  form a table[ Rows and column]

4) Queue Storage Services

     Here we can upload the data which is in the  form of a text messages
    [Exlike SMS, Promotional Messages, notifications etc]

You have uploaded some 200 files inside your SA, and nnow some 40 files you have deleted after 3 days or 5 fays
you realizes that the files were important and you want the files back
then ins this scenarios and sitautions the data protection tab is ehelpful

- data protection
  - enable soft delete for blobs
    ddays to retain the deleted blobs
  - enable soft delte for containers
    days to retain delted containers
  -enalb soft delte for file shares

Tracking

- eanble versioning for blobs
- enable blobo change feed
