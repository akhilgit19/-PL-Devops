Introduction to Cloud:
============================
   - Devops Projects:
      ---> Use this project in reusme
                - Banking/ Retails     ====> Phase 1 - ( Here you will be using defulat vpc, subnets)

      ---> AWS Cloud Services          =====> Phase 2 - ( Here you will create a dedicated vpc,subnets, routetables, intergetatway)
                                             within the private network you will deploy through jenkins and implement your services using kubernetes
                                             by  the help of load balancer.

		What is Cloud Computing?

		- If you want to avail , servers ,databases ,storage,networking from internet instead of onpremsis

    why is cloud computing important?

    - faster service provisioning
      dynamic scalability
      good reliablitiy
      cost effective 
      higher productivity 
      efficient performance
      high security

    Diffent Layers of cloud computing

      Applications           Software as a serveice      applications
      programming            platform as a service       Programming
