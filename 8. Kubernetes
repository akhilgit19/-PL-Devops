	Container Orchestration using Kubernetes ::::
	
	- Kubernetes!
	
	Docker Container : 
	
	AWS :	ECS/ECR/EKS
	
	Azure : ACS/ACR/AKS
	
	GCP :	GCE/GCR/GKE

	- Kubernetes!
	
		- It is a Open-Source Container Orchestration Tool 
		- Kubernetes is used to Deploy any type of Containers.
		- It is used to ensure high availability of the Applications/services running thru Containers.
		- Used to Ensure High Availability of Containers by creating Replicas of Containers.
		- It supports Auto-Scaling & Load Balancing.		
		

	- Kubernetes Architecture :::
		
		Based on:
		
			Kubernetes_Control_Plane/Master 
				- Kubernetes_WorkerNode1,2,3,4,5
	

		- App Config file - Manifest file - *.yaml / *.json		
        - Once ready with the manifest file , we use kubectl to interact with Kubernetes master components
        - API server acts as a interface betwween user request and kubernetes master
        - Any task will execute in POD
        - Scheduler will always idenfitier the suitable node
        - kublet is an agent upon running  kubernetes worker components
        - CRI- Container runtime interface, it will download the image then kublet will identify and deploy it into the pod
        - Controll Manger ensures that pod is running in it;s own desire state.
