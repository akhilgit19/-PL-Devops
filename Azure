	Introduction to Azure Cloud Services ::::

Azure Virtual Machines- key concepts

Feature       Explanation
=======      ================
Image         choose operating system and software
VM Family     choose the right family of hardware( General Purpose or compute/storage/memory optimized or GPU or HPC)
VM Size       choose the right quanitiy of hardware( 2 CPUS 4 GB of memory
Disks         attach virutal disks to VMS( Block storage)

Availablity
- Are the applications avaialbe when the users need them
- Ex 99.99% availablity also called four 9's availablity

Availablity table:           Downtime                 Comment
-99.95%                         22 minutes          
-99.99%(four 9's)               4 and 1/2 minutest     Most online apps aim for 99.99%
-99.999%(five 9's)              26 seconds             Achieving 5 9's availaablity is tough
	

Azure app services- Infrastructure as service
Container services- platform as a service --  Container Orchestration- Azure kubernetes service , azure service fabric


Azure Service Name        Description
======================================================================
Azure VMS                   windows or linux VM( IAAS), Use VMS when  you need control over OS or you want to run custoom software
                            you handle availablity, scalablity,load balancing,software/OS updates

Azure App Service            Paas, Deploy web apps, mobile back ends and  RestfulAPI's quickly

Azure Contienr Instances     Paas(CaaS) Run isollated containers without orchestartion. YOu do not need to provision and manage VMS's start containers in seconds


Azure kubernetes service    Paas(CaaS), Managed kubernetes service. Provides container orchaestration

Azure Service Fabric     Paas(CaaS). Microsoft container orchastertor. packag, deploy and manage scalable and reliable microservices
                         Run anywhere- on premises and in the cloud

Azure Functions         Serverless(FaaS) compute for event driven apps


Azure Compute Services- Scenarios
===================================
Scenario                                                 Solution

You want to run function in reponse to events                       Azure Functions
You wnat to deploy a Python application using a                     Azure app services
managed service 
	
You want to quickly deploy a container                               Azure container instances
You want to setup a complex micorservices architecture in Azure      AKS or service fabric
Your application needs cutomized OS and custom software installed    Azure VMS


Axure Storage:
- Managed Cloud Storage Solution
  - High available , durable and massively scalable
- Core Storage Services
  - Azure Disks: Block storage( hard disks) for Azure VMS
  - Azure Files: File shares for cloud and on premises
  - Azure Blobs: Object store for text and binary data
  - Azure Queeus: Decouple applications using messaging
  - Azure Tables: No SQL store( Very Basic)
	
	
Premium Storage Account: For high performance
 Standard General- Purpose storage accounts: Recommened for most scenarios
 . what we have looked at until now!
high performance: what if you need very high performance?
 . Premium storage account: Usses solid- state drives( SSDS) for low latency
   and high throughput
 . Contstraint: Fewer Redundancy options( LRS ZRS)
 . Supported Premium Account types: 
      Premium block blobs- Blob Storage, Data Lake Storage
      Premium file shares: Supporting both SMB and NFS File shares
      Premium page blobs

Database Terminology: RTO and RPO
RPO (Recovery point objective): Maximum acceptable period of data loss
RTO( Recovery time objective) Maximum accpetable downtime


Databases- Summary

Database Type       Azure Services                            Description

Relation OLTP       Azure SQL database, azure                 Transactional usecases needing predefined
databses            database for Mysql, azure database        schema and very stong transactional capablities
                    for postgreSQL etc

Relation OLAP     Azure Synapse Anlytics                      Cloumnar Storage with rpedefined schema
databsed                                                   Datawareshousing and big data workloads

No SQL databases     Azure Cosmos DB                         Apps needing quickly evolving structure
                                                            (schema-less)
                                                            MongoDB(Dcoument ,cassandra(key/vaalue) and gremlin graph
   
In memory             Azure Cache for Redis                Applications needing microsencond responses
databases/caches


Database Scenarios
=======================

Scenario                                                     Solution
A start up with qucily evolving schema( table structure)      Consmos DB

Single-digit millisecond response times for global            Cosmos DB
application with millions of usrs 

Transactional local databse processing thousands               Azure SQLdatabase or Azure Database for My SWL or AZURE DATABASE FOR pOSTGREsql
of transactions per sond 

Cache Data( from Database) for a web application               Azure Cache for redis

Database for analytics processing fo petabytes of data           Azure Synapse ANlytics


Azure Neworking Scenarios 
Scenario                                                                 Solution
You need to create  a secure, isolated network in the cloud              Azure Virutal Netowkr
similar to your corportate network 

You want to connect resources in different Virutal Network, potentially    Network peering
in different regions 

You need protection agains DDOSS attacks for your applications              Axure DDOS protections( Basic or standard)
You want a managed network security service to control traffic across       Azure firewall
multiple virutal network and subscription 

You need to restrict traffic witing your virutual network using internal     Network Security groups
firewalls 

You need private access to azure PaaS service from witing your virutal Network   Azure Private Lnk and private endpiont
