- E- commerce
- large data sotrage
- DR sites and backuops
- to host mobile app
- big data/Data science
- IOT (Internet of Things)


Why GCP?
============
- Superior AI and Machine Learning
- Best in class data analytics
- Multi cloud and hybrid cloud flexibliity
- Global Network Infrastructure
- Cost Effective Pricing and Discounts
- Security and Compliance
- Kubernetes, Anthos, Vmware
- sustainablility and carbon neutral cloud


Deployment Models
====================
- Public 
    - Application Services
    - platform services
    - Message services
    - Compute servcies
    - Storage services
 1.The most widely cloud model
 2.The data center is hosted at the cloud services
 3.Users can acess it via the internet
 4.The Public cloud is shared among multiple organizations
 5.They Cloud provider handles all aspects of  hardware and data center management
 6.it offers a cost effective solution with no hardeware mainteance  requuired
 7.operates on a pay as you use pricing model


- Private
 1) A private cloud is a platform build and maintained by a single organization
 2) it can be hosted on premises and accessed thorough a private network.
 3) The organization owns both the hardware and software
 4) There are upfront investment and operations costs involved.
 5) Compared to the public cloud a private cloud offers greated hardware and enhanced security.

Eg- HP, Oracle, SAP AHAN, CICO

- Hybrid

Private + Public

- community cloud:
  Community cloud is a private cloud model 
  that allows multiple organizations to 
  share the same platofrm

eg- health care ,govt websites

 IAM RESOURCES AND ACCESS 
==================================
.Google Cloud resource Hierarchy
.Policy Inheritance
.Identiy and Access Management( IAM)
.IAM roles
.Service accounts


Organization:
===================
Root Node in the google cloud resource hierarchy
Hierarchical ancestor of project resources and folders
Organization adminstrators have central control of all resources
An organization ID, Which is a unique identifier for an organzation

Organization node is the top most resources
- Everything attached to the account goes under the organization node


Folders
============

-To sub-organiazations within the organization
additional grouping mechanism and isolation boundaries between projects and  organization

-Folders can be used to model different legal entitie, deparrtments adn teams  within a company

-Each team folder could contain additional sub-folders to represent different  applications
folders acts as a policy inheritance point for Cloud IAM and organization policies


Folders can contain subfolders and projecdts

- The resources inherit policies and permission assigned to folders

Folders group projects
- Folders allow you to group resources on per daepartment basis

Folders faciliate policy inheritance
- The projects inherit policies assigned to a folder




Projects
============

Project is the base-level organizin entity

Two identifiers: Project ID and Project  number(read-only)
One mutable display name.

The lifecycle state of the project; for example, ACTIVE or DETELTE_REQUESTEDD
Projects are linked to Billing Accounts

Shut down project "My First Project"
When you shut down a project:

Charges from your previous usage may continue to appear for up to a day.
To avoid unexpected charges, disable billing for the project before shutting it down.
Traffic serving stops within a few hours.
You will no longer have access to the project.
The project will be permanently deleted after 30 days. However, some resources may be permanently deleted sooner.
The owners of the project will be notified and can stop the deletion within 30 days.

IAM-POLICY INHERITANCE
- IAM Policies can be set the organization folder project and resource levels
- A resource inherits policies from its parent resource.
- if a policy is set at the organization level it is inheritedby all child  folders and projects
- if a poilicy is set at the project elvel it is inherited by all child resources
- They effective  policy of a resource is the combination of the policy set on the resource and the 
  policies inherited  from its parent entities
- Resources inheri policies from their project which in turn inherits policies form the organization
- Organaiztion level policies also apply at the resource level


- organization- dashboard- project info- go to project settings
- project name - Demo-PaperLive
- Project id 
- Project number

- You can go to IAM resource  IN the VIEW BY PRINCIPALS
- You can see your id ,name and role-owner
- you can provide access by click on grant access and ,
  new prinicpals- mail id
  role-   basic  you wil lhave owner,editor browser and viewer




IAM - WHO-  mail id
      what - role- resource role
      which- which resource


IAM
- Who (identity) has what access (role) to which resource defines the fundamental structure of Cloud IAM
- Google kubernetes engine GKE clusters and cloud storage buckets are examples of google cloud resources
- permission are grouped into roles and roles are assigned to authenticated members
- A cloud IAM policy defines and enforces which roles are granted to which members and this  policy  is attached to a resource
- Organizations folder projects used to organize resources are also conisdered resources google cloud
- When an authentication member attempts to a resource, Cloud IAM checks the reourdces policy to 
  to determinte whether the action is allowed


IAM Components

Member: A member can be a google account(for end unsers), a service account( for apps and virtual machine),
a google group, or cloud identiy domain that can  access a resources.\\
The identiy of a member is an email address associated with a user,service account
or googlegroup or a domain name associated with  Gsuite or cloud identiy domains


Role:
 A role is a collection of permissions. Permission determine what 
what operatiosn are allowed when you grant a role to a member, you grant all the permission that the role contains

Policy: The Cloud IAM policy binds one or more members to a role. When you want to define who (member) has what type of access(role) 
on  a resource, you create a policy and attach it to the resource.


Service accounts are assigned roles
==========================================
                  Service account
Virtual mahcine----  Create a service--------------- cloud storage
                     account to authenticate
                     the VM to cloud storage

- To create service account

-Service Account details
- click on IAM
- click on service accoutns
- click on service acconts
- service account name- data-copy
- service account -id -data copy
- click on create and continue

Grant this servie account  access to the project

- select a role- serach for storage- select storage admin
- click on continue

- Grant users access to this service account(optiona)

- click on done
- now click on data-copy, click on 3 dots, click on managedkey, 
  click on add key, click on create key, download and copy
